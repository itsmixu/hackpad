# Mixu's Macropad // Hack Club Hackpad
My own little macropad for my desk :D 
It has 2 layers to work with: one for media controls and the other has copy, paste and undo, the knob click changes layers. It runs KMK so it is very easy to change afterwards if/when I want to add more functionality.
There also is one RGB LED, and I plan to use it as a status LED. The OLED screen will have some animation and maybe some stats about my PC.

## Overview
- 3 macro buttons with 2 layers
- Rotary encoder knob
- 0.96" OLED display
- 1 status RGB LED
- XIAO RP2040 + KMK firmware

The PCB is sandwiched in between the case parts, with nuts on the bottom.
